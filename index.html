        <p class="card-text"><span class="text-danger">Welcome to my Epicodus project portfolio.</span> The purpose of this page show off some of the projects I've been working on over the weeks at this program. Additionally, it's a good place to tell you a little more about myself. </p>
        <p class="card-text">I grew up in the suburbs near <em>Bellevue, WA</em> and I was interested in computers from an early age. Some of my earliest memories consist of working with my dad to try and manage system memory to get games to work on an old 386-based PC, and I've been hooked ever since. So, I was very excited when my fourth grade class undertook a year-long project of creating computer games written in a language called <a href="https://el.media.mit.edu/logo-foundation/what_is_logo/logo_programming.html">Logo</a>, a programming language designed as a learning tool. Mine was called <em>Danger Zone</em> and featured aeronautical trivia and interactive segments where you would have to navigate planes to their landing strips. After that my interest in computers remained a constant hobby, whether it was through gaming, assembling PC hardware for myself and friends, or small-scale coding projects.</p>
        <p class="card-text">I've dabbled in programming over the years, and my career up until this point has had me managing a number development teams, so it seemed like a logical evolution for me to transition into software development as a profession. </p>
